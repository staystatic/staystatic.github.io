## What's Stay Static? {#whatis}

Inspired by the tradition of [ToDoMVC](http://todomvc.com) that helps you select an MV\* framework
or [Hacker News readers as Progressive Web Apps (HNPWA)](https://hnpwa.com) that helps you select a progressive web app stack,
the Stay Static Series presents the world's greatest static website compilers / builders / generators in action
that helps you select a tool to build your next website.

Let's build modern, faster, better websites that run on any web server or even on "server-less" web storage services.
No database or application server required (once built and ready-to-serve).
Upload your HTML, CSS, JS and media files and voila! That's it.

The one design, many samples showcases how to build a website with:

1. Posts
2. Pages
3. Custom Content Types (e.g. Bookmarks 'n' Links)
